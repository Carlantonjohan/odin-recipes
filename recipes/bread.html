<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 packet (2 ¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups warm water (about 110°F or 43°C)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and melted butter.</li>
    <li>Mix until a dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours.</li>
    <li>Once risen, punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place it in a greased 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
    <li>Cover the loaf with a cloth and let it rise again until doubled, about 30-60 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
